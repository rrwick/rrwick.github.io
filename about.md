I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Kathryn Holtâ€™s lab at Monash University where I work on assembly algorithms for bacterial genomes. I have a particular interest in long-read assembly (especially using Oxford Nanopore reads) and hybrid assembly which combines both short and long reads. I'm the developer of [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler), [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), [Filtlong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong), [Badread](https://github.com/rrwick/Badread), [Trycycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler) and [Polypolish](https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish).

I created this blog to share some interesting findings that are too small to warrant a paper and other miscellaneous thoughts. While I actually made the blog in December 2022, I've put in some older bits from the [Trycycler documentation](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler/wiki).
