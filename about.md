I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity](https://www.doherty.edu.au) where I work on assembly algorithms for bacterial genomes. I did my master's and PhD in [Kat Holt's group](https://holtlab.net). I have a particular interest in long-read assembly (especially using Oxford Nanopore reads) and hybrid assembly which combines both short and long reads. I'm the developer of [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler), [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), [Filtlong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong), [Badread](https://github.com/rrwick/Badread), [Trycycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler) and [Polypolish](https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish).

I created this blog to share some interesting findings that are too small to warrant a paper and other miscellaneous thoughts. While I actually made the blog in December 2022, I've also included some older topics from the [Trycycler documentation](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler/wiki). I've given each blog post a DOI using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), so you can cite them if you use them in your research :smile:
