I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Kathryn Holtâ€™s lab at Monash University where I work on assembly algorithms for bacterial genomes. I have a particular interest in long-read assembly (especially using Oxford Nanopore reads) and hybrid assembly which combines both short and long reads. I'm the developer of Bandage, Unicycler, Porechop, Filtlong and Badread. More recently, I've developed Trycycler and Polypolish, two tools which aim to enable zero-error bacterial genome assemblies.
